KartCalendar - KartStream in it's current state...

Self Guided Solo Rails project to serve the Owner Driver Karting World in the UK.

Rails 7... a little Hotwire here and there, PostGres, Pundit, Devise, Image Processing and a few API's for weather, maps, locations etc

It's not perfect, it's not pretty but I did it.

Allows Driver, Parents, Team Owners and Mechanics to View information on all Tracks, Events and Championships available to them. Also added a feature for them to create an account, follow some tracks/events etc and then it will create them their own calendar on their dashboard. Helps them refer to dates quickly, check race clashes etc

Also recently working on a feature to allow them to create an engine in their account so they can store it's information and also the records of it service's carried out and Dyno performance, sorts of acts like a digital logbook.

More to come...



30/9/2024 - Plenty of work to do yet, but I'm happy with the progress.

Worked on Refactoring, Performance and Code Quality over the last month. Looked at Event and Track models and controllers to make them more efficient and faster, cleaned up the views on the way through to use a few more partials and reuse those components where possible.

Learnt alot about the correct use db queries, eager loading and caching in an attempt to make the site more performant.

Cleaned up the services too and removed some of that code from the controllers.

The Championships Model and controller still needs some work but happy with September 2024.
